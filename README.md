## The Big Picture
C4C aims to promote access, for members of a given community district, through engagement. We have developed a solution to identify the most frequently reported 311 service requests, in the last 30 days, and correlated these details to a users respective community board. Moreover, we have provided a forum for discussion where pertinent issues can be identified among community members and brought to the attention of local leadership more often than monthly scheduled meetings allow for.


#### NYC Community Boards
The community boards of the New York City government are the appointed advisory groups of the community districts of the five boroughs. There are currently 59 community districts, including twelve in Manhattan, twelve in the Bronx, eighteen in Brooklyn, fourteen in Queens, and three in Staten Island. According to the New York City Charter, the primary role of community board are to cooperate with, consult, assist and advise elected governmental officials about any matter that: 
> “relates to the welfare of the Community District and its residents.”

#### Bridging The Gap
C4C serves as an avenue for *anyone* in the community to engage in meaningful discussion about their local community district. Community boards typically meet once per month and set aside time to hear the public at meetings. Additionally, meetings are to be available for broadcasting and cable-casting. The issue, however, is that a majority of constituents are vastly uninformed about what's discussed and where to locate this public information. A simple Google search does not provide a one-stop shop for answers. C4C can ideally be utilized as a tool to optimize the distribution of information and indirectly reach a larger network of people.
